# projet

This project is a Python-based tool for predicting and evaluating the secondary structure of proteins using hydrogen bond detection and energy calculations. The tool compares the predicted secondary structure with the DSSP-assigned secondary structure to calculate accuracy, helix sensitivity, and beta-sheet sensitivity.
